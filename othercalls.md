## Call for Vendor Presentations

Do you want to inform the attendees about your new product? You can demonstrate your tools live and provide latest information on features. Since only a limited number of vendor presentations can be held, please contact us as soon as possible via mc15@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de, providing title, presenter(s), and an abstract of the presentation. The price is 200 €/ tutorial and free for open source tools.

Decision about the acceptance of vendor presentations will be based upon Modelica/FMI relation of content and on the time of application.

All items are limited, based on first-come-first-served basis. Do not hesitate to contact us for any special needs. The deadline for application is **August 15th, 2021**.

## Call for Tutorials

At the Modelica conference, several tutorials will take place in parallel. Each tutorial will last for up to 3 hours and includes a “hands-on-experience” session (participants are expected to have own notebook; the presenter will provide the presented tools). If you are interested, please contact us via mc15@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de, providing title, presenter(s), and an abstract of the tutorial. The deadline for application is **August 15th, 2023; however, as only a limited number of tutorials can be held in parallel, we advise you to apply as early as possible.

Tutorials are free for the participants, but especially for commercial tools the presenter is charged 250 € per session, provided it is a hands on training tutorial, not just commercial presentation or demonstration (for product presentations see Vendor sessions above). Upon written request some tutorials, especially non-commercial, (e.g. FMI, Open Source libraries etc.), could be exempted from the fee by decision of the organising committee.

Decision about the acceptance of tutorials will be based upon Modelica/FMI relation of content and on the time of application.
