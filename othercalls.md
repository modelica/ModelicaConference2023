## Call for Vendor Presentations

Do you want to inform the attendees about your new product? You can demonstrate your tools live and provide latest information on features. Since only a limited number of vendor presentations can be held, please contact us as soon as possible via mc15@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de, providing title, presenter(s), and an abstract of the presentation. The price is 500 €/ vendor presentation.

Decision about the acceptance of vendor presentations will be based upon Modelica/FMI relation of content and on the time of application.

All items are limited, based on first-come-first-served basis. Do not hesitate to contact us for any special needs. The deadline for application is **August 15th, 2023**.

## Call for Tutorials

At the Modelica conference, several tutorials will take place in parallel. Each tutorial will last for up to 3 hours and includes a “hands-on-experience” session (participants are expected to have own notebook; the presenter will provide the presented tools). If you are interested, please contact us via mc15@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de, providing title, presenter(s), and an abstract of the tutorial. The deadline for application is **August 15th, 2023; however, as only a limited number of tutorials can be held in parallel, we advise you to apply as early as possible.**

Tutorials are free for the participants, but especially for commercial tools the presenter is charged 250 € per session, provided it is a hands on training tutorial, not just commercial presentation or demonstration (for product presentations see Vendor sessions above). Upon written request some tutorials, especially non-commercial, (e.g. FMI, Open Source libraries etc.), could be exempted from the fee by decision of the organising committee.

Decision about the acceptance of tutorials will be based upon Modelica/FMI relation of content and on the time of application.
