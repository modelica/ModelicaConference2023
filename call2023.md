The conference proceedings will be published by the Modelica Association on its website and by  [Linköping University Electronic Press](http://www.ep.liu.se/)..
Each paper will be individually referenced by a DOI.

## Call for Libraries

You are encouraged to submit a  **free Modelica application library**  in Modelica source code form.
The library should be sent to the program chair ([mc15@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de](mailto:mc15@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de)) and provided under the [3-clause BSD License for the Modelica Association](https://modelica.org/licenses/modelica-3-clause-bsd).
**Please submit also a corresponding paper to the conference.**
If the paper gets accepted, you can present your library at the conference. The best two submitted libraries will receive awards of 500 EUR and 250 EUR.

Libraries are evaluated according to the following criteria:

-   How useful is the library for the Modelica community, especially for industrial applications?
-   Basic design principle of the library (e.g. physical components are modeled in a declarative way and there are no un-physical restrictions how components can be connected together).
-   Completeness and extent of the library (small or large library, examples).
-   Usage of the library (component documentation, users guide, parameter menus, etc.)

Accepted libraries will be included on the conference stick and linked from the Modelica web site.

## Call for Industrial User Presentations

You are encouraged to submit an  **extended abstract**  of 1-2 pages, related to one of the existing or possibly new  [Modelica Association Projects](https://modelica.org/projects):

-   LANG - Modelica Language
-   LIB - Modelica Libraries
-   FMI - Functional Mockup Interface (doubles as the [FMI user meeting](fmi-user-meeting.html))
-   SSP - System Structure and Parameterization of Components for Virtual System Design
-   DCP - Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol
-  eFMI - Functional Mock-up Interfaces for embedded systems

The abstracts will be peer-reviewed by experts, but no papers will be published in the conference proceedings.  You can upload your abstract using the [conference tool](https://www.conftool.com/modelica2023/) .

Please note that purely tool-related presentations are not permitted for these application-oriented presentations, they should be covered by [vendor presentations](othercalls.md).
