# Authors' guide

## Submission process

Information about the submission process is following soon.

## Preparation of full papers

The template has been updated for the 2021 conference, so do not use older versions of the template.
Please use the [LaTeX template](https://github.com/modelica-association/conference-templates/tree/master/LaTeX) for the creation of full papers.
There is a [Word template](https://github.com/modelica-association/conference-templates/tree/master/MSWord) that is based on the LaTeX template.
The Word template contains some wording specific to LaTeX packages; when drafting a document in Word, please make the contents look similar to what the LaTeX templates produce.
For draft paper submissions, you may also use other templates (but include an extra page at the end stating you will use the correct template for the final submission).

Please make sure that your submission has been created according to the [Modelica Formatting Guidelines](formatting.md).

For the final submission, there will also be the possibility to submit Modelica example model files that correspond to your publication. These files will then be attached to your paper in the Modelica Association copy of the proceedings (but not the LiU e-press copy that the DOI points to).

## Final Paper Submission

Additionally to your paper, you should also submit a [copyright agreement](Modelica2023_copyright_form.md) that gives the Modelica Association the non-exclusive right to publish your paper. 
 
We appreciate if you upload a one-page abstract, too.
Use the same template as for the paper, but cut it down to a teaser for attendees.

## Technical equipment for presentations

Papers must be presented during the conference in person. Papers that are not presented will be retracted.
